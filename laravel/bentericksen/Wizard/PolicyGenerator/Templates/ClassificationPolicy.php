		<h2>EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION</h2>
		(Optional – All versions)
		For purposes of benefits eligibility, you are classified according to specific terms and definitions. Below are the types of employee classifications that we may use:
		<br>
		Regular Full-Time Employees—individuals who regularly work 		 or more hours within a workweek. Under special conditions (illness, etc.), you may work fewer hours in a week for up to 3 months without losing your regular full time status. This time may be extended at our discretion.
		<br>
		Regular Part-Time Employees—individuals who work more than __________ and less than _________ hours within a workweek.
		<br>
		Temporary Employees—individuals whose service is intended to be of limited duration, whether working in a full-time or part-time capacity. Temporary employees are not eligible for benefits at any time.
		<br>
		Change in Employee Status—during employment, a change in status may result for any number of reasons. When that occurs, the following guidelines will be applied: 
		<br>
		If you change from part-time to full-time status, you are considered a new employee and will be subject to applicable waiting periods for benefits. For example, if full-time employees earn 1 week paid vacation after 1 year of service, and 3 weeks after 5 years, the former part-time employee must complete 1 year of full-time service before earning a 1 week paid vacation, and 5 years before earning 3 weeks of paid vacation. 
		<br>
		At our discretion, you may change from part-time status to full-time status and receive a 50 percent service credit for years previously worked as part-time. For example, if you worked part-time for 4 years, you would receive a service credit of 2 years.
		<br>
		At the time of the change, you will be paid for any unused benefits earned at part-time status and start earning benefits at full-time status.
		<br>
		If you work full-time and you change to part-time status, you will be paid for any unused benefits earned at full-time status and start earning benefits at part-time status.
