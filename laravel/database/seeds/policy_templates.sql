When family and medical leave is taken for a serious illness or for bone marrow or organ donation, you are required to substitute any earned paid leave benefits, including paid sick or medical leave, provided the situation qualifies for paid leave under the sick or medical leave policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical insurance benefits, if applicable, will continue until the end of the month in which the leave begins. After the initial month, you may be eligible for continuation coverage (see continuation policy, if applicable, at the end of this manual).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During family and medical leave, you retain all employment benefits earned prior to the date the leave began. However, you are not entitled to earn seniority or other benefits during leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reinstatement to Work</strong>&mdash;if you intend to return to work sooner than originally scheduled, please give reasonable advance notice, such as 2 business days, of the intended date of return so that return to work can be properly scheduled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you take a leave due to a serious health condition of your own, except when leave is taken on an intermittent or reduced-schedule basis, you must provide a note from your treating physician verifying that you are able to return to work and can assume your regular work duties.

If you average 32 hours in a workweek, you will have up to 554.5 hours of leave. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pregnancy leave will be counted against any family and medical leave entitlements required by federal law. At the conclusion of leave due to disability, an additional 12 weeks of leave for childbirth may be available under the state family and medical leave, which applies to employers with 50 or more employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Intermittent </strong><strong>Leave/Reduced Work Schedule</strong>&mdash;is allowable when medically necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reporting on </strong><strong>Progress</strong>&mdash;you are required to report directly to us every 30 days on your health status and your intent to return to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Salary and </strong><strong>Benefits</strong>&mdash;the leave of absence is without pay. However, you may take any earned paid time off to run concurrently with the pregnancy leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health insurance, if applicable, will continue during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions that existed before leave began. Therefore, if the premium is shared between you and us, you are responsible for your share of the health insurance premium while on leave. There are 2 payment options: 1) Prepayment before the leave, 2) Pay as the premiums become due, which may be either monthly or quarterly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefits earned prior to taking leave will not be reduced, other than any paid time off used during pregnancy leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you return from leave, benefits will again be provided according to the applicable policies and plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pregnancy Leave of Absence Ends When</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You are released for full or partial duty.

You will be reinstated no later than the agreed upon date or earlier if possible. However, business reasons may prevent us from having you return before the agreed upon date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reinstatement to </strong><strong>Work</strong>&mdash;you must provide a completed <em>Medical Release to Work</em> <em>Form</em>, or an equivalent note from your healthcare provider, verifying that you are able to return to work and can assume your regular work duties.

To comply with this law, we ask that you not provide any genetic information when responding to this request for medical information. &ldquo;Genetic Information&rdquo; as defined by GINA includes an individual&rsquo;s *family medical history*, the results of an individual&rsquo;s or family member&rsquo;s genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual&rsquo;s family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual&rsquo;s family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.</span></span></b></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"border:none; text-align:center; padding:0in; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"border:none; text-align:center; padding:0in; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span arial=\"\" narrow=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">*Family medical history may be acquired as part of the certification process for leave where an employee is asking for leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition. </span></span></b></span></span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><span class=\"Heading2Char\" style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span arial=\"\" narrow=\"\" style=\"font-family:\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Salary and Benefits</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span arial=\"\" narrow=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">&mdash;the leave of absence is generally without pay.

Leave from work is available so that you can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Seek medical attention for, or recover from, physical or psychological injuries resulting from domestic violence, sexual assault, gender violence, or stalking to you or your family/household member</li>\r\n	<li>Obtain services from a victim services organization for you or your family/household member</li>\r\n	<li>Acquire psychological or other counseling for you or your family/household member</li>\r\n	<li>Participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocating, or taking other actions to increase the safety of you or your family/household member from future domestic violence, sexual assault, gender violence, or stalking or to ensure economic security&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Obtain legal assistance or remedies to ensure the health and safety of you or your family/household member, including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceedings related to or derived from domestic violence, sexual assault, gender violence, or stalking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Leave will be unpaid unless you choose to use any paid time off benefit available at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health insurance, if applicable, will continue during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions that existed before the leave began. Therefore, if the premium is shared between you and us, you are responsible for your share of the health insurance premium while on leave. There are 2 payment options: 1) Prepayment before the leave, 2) Pay as the premiums become due, which may be either monthly or quarterly. Failure to pay your share of the health insurance premium may result in a loss of coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need to take leave under this policy, you must provide at least 48 hours&rsquo; advance notice of your intention to take leave, unless providing such notice is not practicable. When the need for leave is unforeseeable, you must provide certification to us within a reasonable time after the absence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be required to verify that you or your family/household member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, gender violence, or stalking and the leave is for one of the purposes outlined above. If required, verification must be provided in a timely manner. You can provide verification through one or more of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A sworn statement by you</li>\r\n	<li>A police or court record&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Documentation from an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional from whom you or your family/household member has sought assistance in addressing domestic violence, sexual assault, gender violence, or stalking and the effect of the violence</li>\r\n	<li>Other corroborating evidence</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We will treat information you provide confidentially.

One-third (1/3) of the premium will be collected for Family Leave, and 2/3 of the premium for Medical Leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The premium is shared between us (employer = 37% and employee = 63%). Employers with fewer than 50 employees are not required to pay the employer portion of the premium but are still required to collect and remit the employee portion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Premium payments are required to be paid quarterly.

Under the ‘‘rolling’’ 12 month period, each time an employee takes Paid Family and Medical Leave, the remaining leave entitlement would be the balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the immediately preceding 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>            Example:</strong> Michael requests three weeks of medical leave to begin on July 31st. The employer looks back 12 months (from July 31st back to the previous August 1st) to see if any leave had been used. Michael had not taken any previous leave, so he is entitled to the three weeks he requested and has nine more weeks available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eligibility</strong>—to qualify for paid family and medical leave, you must have worked at least 820 hours or more in the qualifying period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 820 hours you need to qualify can be accrued at more than one employer. For example, if worked 15 hours a week at two different employers, you would accrue 30 hours per week toward this program’s qualifying hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Qualifying Period</strong>—the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters starting from the day you intend to take leave. If you don’t qualify by that standard, the last four completed calendar quarters will be used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paid family leave may be granted for the following reasons: </p>\n\n<ul><li>The birth of a child</li>\n	<li>The placement of a child under 18 for adoption or foster care </li>\n	<li>The serious health condition* of your family member (spouse, domestic partner, child or parent)</li>\n	<li>Any “qualifying exigency” (as the Secretary shall, by regulation, determine) arising out of the fact that your spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent is on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation or a member of the Armed Forces who is deployed in a foreign country</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Paid medical leave may be granted for the following reasons</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your own serious health condition*</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility; or continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Length of Leave</strong>—up to 12 weeks of leave are generally available, though up to 18 weeks could be allowed in some circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Job Protection</strong>—provided that we employ 50 or more employees and you worked at least 12 months (not continuous in some circumstances) and at least 1,250 hours in the preceding year, family or medical leave under the program is protected, meaning you must be returned to the same or comparable position at the end of the leave period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Notification of </strong><strong>Leave</strong>—you must provide notification of your intention to take leave. If an event is foreseeable, you must provide 30 days’ notice. If the event is unforeseeable, you must provide notice as soon as practicable. For example, if you have a medical procedure appointment that will be the start of your leave, you must give your employer 30 days’ notice of your intention to take leave. <u>Your application to the Employment Security Department isn’t considered notice to your employer</u>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong>—while on leave, you are entitled to progressive wage replacement.
