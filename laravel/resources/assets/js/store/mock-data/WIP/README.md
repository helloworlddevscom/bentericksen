He. It's a brief readme, but none of the E2E tests in WIP will work as it because the seed reference
is one folder level up. 

If you want to activate any of these old tests, you'll need to move it one level up
and ALSO move the corresponding seed JS object one directory up.   Then you should be
able to run again (...though backward compatibilty is a YMMV)
